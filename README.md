# LSTM model to predict predict the number of airline passengers
### Data set discription
The dataset provides monthly total number of a US airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.
> It contains 2 columns:
<ol>
  <li> Month </li>
  <li> Passengers: number of passengers in this month </li>
</ol>

### Main Idea
using this data as Time-Series and use previous months data to predict the future number of passengers by applying LSTM model to use 2 months data to predict the next one.
